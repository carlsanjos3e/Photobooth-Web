Photobooth Web was a personal project of mine that I thought of after passing by the photobooth shop at SM City Legazpi. I didn't have cash on me at the time, and wanted to take booth-style
photos, so I tried making my own. Right now, I've only focused on the functional aspects and kept the design of UI/UX to a minimum. I tend to put more emphasis on how it should work, and not 
much on how it should look like. It may not be much but I'm proud of my work.
